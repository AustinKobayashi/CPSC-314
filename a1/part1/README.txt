I changed the movement for the bunny a little. The "w" key didn't cause the bunny
to move forwards relative to its rotation, so I just reordered the keys so that:
- "w" moves the bunny forward relative to the model
- "s" moves the bunny backward relative to the model
- "d" moves the bunny right relative to the model
- "a" moves the bunny left relative to the model
